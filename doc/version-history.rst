Version History
===============

.. At the time of writing the Version history/release notes are not yet standardized amongst CSCs.
.. Until then, it is not expected that both a version history and a release_notes be maintained.
.. It is expected that each CSC link to whatever method of tracking is being used for that CSC until standardization occurs.
.. No new work should be required in order to complete this section.
.. Below is an example of a version history format.
